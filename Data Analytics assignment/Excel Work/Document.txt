Task 2 - Data Cleaning (Completed in Excel)
In the Data(All Events Data) Updated file, I completed the following data cleaning tasks:

Identify and Remove Duplicates:
Removed duplicate rows based on the Emails column to ensure unique entries.

Remove Null Values:
Identified and removed rows containing null (empty) values across all columns.

Filter Data for Designation:
Extracted data where the Designation column is marked as "Student."

Combine Responses:
Combined responses from the 'How did you come to know about this event?' column into the Others column.
Renamed the combined column as 'Others (After combining)'.

Saved Updated File:
Saved the final cleaned dataset as Data(All Events Data) Updated, which includes all the necessary updates.
